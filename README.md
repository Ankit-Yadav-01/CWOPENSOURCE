Hi to whosoever reading this,
my hometown is Ballia(UTTAR PRADESH) but I have done my schooling from Noida (U.P. - Yes Noida is in U.P.).
I do love playing and watching cricket.
So, Yep in short that is all about me.

I am interested in open source as it gives us a platform to interact with community of enthusiastic coders and gives us a constructive environment to learn and apply ourselves. We can give and take help as well.
